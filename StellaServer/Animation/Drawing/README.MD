# Drawers

Drawers are used to generate frames. There are multiple animators available that use different strategies:

1. Repeating patterns
2. Sliding pattern


#### 1. Repeating patterns
Repeats one or multiple patterns over the length of the led strip. Each frame is a different pattern, repeated. 

#### 2. Sliding pattern

Repeats a pattern over the length of the led strip. With each frame, the starting point of the patterns is moved by 1 pixel to the right.
